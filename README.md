# 🐍 Python Practice by Deepu

Hi! I'm Deepu 💖 and this is where I practice Python every day.  
I'm learning it step by step like a 7-year-old child — slowly but smartly! 😄

## 📚 Day-wise Practice

- ✅ Day 1: `print()`, variables, basic strings
- ✅ Day 2: `input()`, math with age, data types
- ✅ Day 3: `if-else`, age checker
- ✅ Day 4: comparison operators, mini conditions

I'll update this repo regularly with all my daily lessons, mini projects, and cool Python codes! 🚀

## 🌱 Goal

Learn Python fully, build mini projects, and become a GitHub star ⭐ — all before college placements.

Stay tuned! 💪
